              I am a Full-Stack Website and Systems Engineer with over 15 years
              experience in what I do. I am currently working from the
              Caribbean, in the beautiful twin-island Republic of Trinidad and
              Tobago.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
              Aside from development work, I&apos;m also an avid home cook,
              maintain a small home garden and can enjoy a good webnovel.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              I&apos;m somewhat of a perfectionist with an extreme attention to
              detail, I aim to solve problems methodically and efficiently. I
              strive to maintain a high level of workmanship as I take pride in
              my craft and the value it brings to the table, not just to the
              organization but to the people who use my apps.
